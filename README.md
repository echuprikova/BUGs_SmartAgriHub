Mountain agriculture is a vital social-economic activity in Europe, including the alpine Province of South Tyrol,  Italy.  Here,  apple  orchards  and  vineyards  are  extensively  cultivated.  Besides  the  difficulty  to  cultivate in mountain terrain (steep slopes, difficult accessibility, extreme weather conditions), the plants are  exposed  to  a  combination  of  biotic  and  abiotic  stresses  that  can  derive  into  diseases  caused  by  pathogens.  It  results  in  the  loss  of  the  yield  and  quality  of  products,  economic  losses,  reducing  food  security with severe ecological impacts, and affects many ecosystem services (such as agrotourism). Here we present a digital strategy approach using advanced hardware and software technologies to map the presence of diseases in three different experiments: apple orchard, vineyard, and forestry.  We aim at a non-invasive method to monitor plant diseases and deliver the information to farmers using web-based precision   maps   derived   from   machine   learning   algorithms   based   on   ground   and   aerial   infrared   spectroscopy (hyperspectral/thermal).
