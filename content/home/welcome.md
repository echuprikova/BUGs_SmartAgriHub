Mountain agriculture is a vital social-economic activity in Europe and in the alpine Province of South Tyrol, Italy, in particular. Here, apple orchards and vineyards are a crucial part of traditional agriculture that supports thousands of people's lives. The need for extensive agriculture multiplied with challenges of mountain terrain with steep and rugged slopes, accessibility problems, and extreme weather conditions require good management practices and technology adoption. Besides, the combination of biotic and abiotic stresses caused by various pathogens leads to significant yield and quality losses, thus economic losses. Furthermore, the rapid climate and biodiversity change raises the concern of food security and ecological impacts, which affect many ecosystem services (such as agro-tourism). Here we present a digital strategy that integrates advanced hardware and software technologies to monitor diseases. It will study three different demonstrators: apple orchard, vineyard, and forestry.  We will provide various thematic maps derived from machine learning algorithms that identify pests based on ground and aerial infrared imagery (hyperspectral/thermal).
